# SDET Playwright Portfolio (Python)

A comprehensive SDET portfolio focused on quality engineering at scale. Demonstrates Playwright (Python) automation frameworks, API testing, CI/CD pipelines, containerized execution with Docker, Kubernetes-based test orchestration, and real-world test strategy and architecture decisions.

A professional-grade SDET portfolio demonstrating API and UI automation using Python + Playwright, structured to reflect real-world enterprise test architecture.

## 👋 Overview

This repository serves as a **portfolio landing page** for my work as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET).

Rather than focusing on isolated test scripts, this portfolio emphasizes:
- Test automation **architecture and design**
- Automation **strategy and trade-offs**
- Reliability, scalability, and maintainability
- Integration with **real-world CI/CD pipelines**
- Infrastructure-aware test execution

The goal is to demonstrate **how quality is engineered**, not just how tests are written.

---

## 🧠 SDET Philosophy

I view the SDET role as an **engineering discipline that enables teams to ship with confidence**.

Quality is not defined by the number of tests written, but by:
- The **speed and reliability of feedback**
- The **trustworthiness of automation**
- The **reduction of production risk**

Automation should protect critical user and business flows, integrate seamlessly into CI/CD, and scale as systems grow.  
Flaky or low-signal tests are treated as system problems, not acceptable trade-offs.

---

## 🧰 Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **UI & API Automation:** Playwright  
- **Test Runner:** pytest  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions  
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **Test Orchestration:** Kubernetes  

Tooling choices are driven by **stability, observability, and scalability**, not popularity.

## 🧪 Test Execution Guide

This repository contains two independent automation frameworks:

- API Automation Framework (Playwright Request API)

- UI Automation Framework (Playwright Browser + POM)

These test suites are intentionally executed separately to mirror real-world CI/CD pipeline stages and to prevent event loop conflicts.

⚠️ Note: The FastAPI mock backend must be running locally on http://localhost:8080.

### 🚀 Run API Tests

What this covers:

- Authentication

- CRUD operations

- Negative scenarios

- Validation errors

- Authorization checks

### 🖥 Run UI Tests

What this covers:

- Login success

- Login failure

- Devices page rendering

- Page Object Model structure

## 🧠 Why Separate Execution?

In production-grade automation:

- API and UI tests run in separate CI stages

- API tests are fast and validate business logic

- UI tests validate user workflows

- Separation avoids async loop conflicts and reduces pipeline instability

This architecture mirrors real enterprise automation strategy.

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

🔹 Service Layer (API)

Encapsulates API logic for better reusability and maintainability.

🔹 Page Object Model (UI)

Separates UI structure from test logic.

🔹 Fixtures

Reusable setup for:

- API clients

- Base URLs

- Test configuration

🔹 Behavior-Based Assertions

🔹 Why Playwright for API Testing?

Using Playwright for both API and UI testing allows a single unified toolchain, shared configuration, and consistent CI execution. This mirrors how modern SDET teams reduce tooling fragmentation in real-world environments.

Tests validate actual system behavior instead of fragile UI text.
